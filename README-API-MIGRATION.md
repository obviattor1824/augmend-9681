# AugMend Health - API Migration Guide

This document outlines the process for migrating from local storage to the API-based backend.

## Migration Strategy

We're using a phased approach to migrate data handling from localStorage to the backend API:

1. Phase 1: Implement parallel data storage (API + localStorage fallback)
2. Phase 2: Migrate to API-only with localStorage as offline cache
3. Phase 3: Implement proper authentication and user-specific data

## Current Implementation (Phase 1)

The current implementation uses a hybrid approach:

- All CRUD operations attempt to use the API first
- If the API call fails, it falls back to localStorage
- This ensures a smooth transition and prevents data loss

## Testing the Migration

To test the migration process:

1. Start both the frontend and backend servers
2. Create some reflections in the journal
3. Stop the backend server to test the fallback mechanism
4. Restart the backend to verify data synchronization

## Known Limitations

- No authentication yet (all data is shared)
- No conflict resolution for offline changes
- Limited error handling and recovery

## Next Steps

- Implement user authentication
- Add data synchronization for offline usage
- Migrate Health Assistant and other features to the backend
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
